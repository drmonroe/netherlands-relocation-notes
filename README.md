## A Guide to Help You Understand the Dutch Immigration Process for Highly Skilled Migrants

## Synopsis:


The Dutch Immigratie-en Naturalisatiedienst (IND) provides a method for the immigration of what are known as 'highly skilled migrants'.  These are individuals who possess skills which are needed in The Netherlands, but which are in relatively short supply.

Two of the common methods for acquiring residency as a highly skilled migrant are:

1.) Sponsorship by a Registered Company

A company that's registered with the IND as a sponsor for highly skilled migrants (this requires the company to pay a fee of approximately 4500 Euros and meet certain criteria)

2.) Apply for a European Blue Card

The European Union provides an immigration instrument known as an EU Blue Card. This is recognized across the Eurozone, but uniquely implemented by each member country.

Note that it's best for the Blue Card application to be submitted a few months prior to the applicant's arrival to shorten the wait time once she or he is in-country.

## Details:

* EU Blue Card

The European Blue Card (link - https://ind.nl/en/work/working_in_the_netherlands/pages/eu-blue-card-holder.aspx ) is an immigration instrument that was created in Brussels. Participating EU member countries (all except the UK and Sweden, I think) choose how this is issued.  In The Netherlands, the IND administers and processes Blue Card applications (see link for full details).

The Blue Card acts as a combination work authorization and residency card.


* Education Verification

Blue Card applicants must possess post high school education of at least three years.  Diplomas and degrees are verified by the SBB (link: https://www.s-bb.nl/en ).  Note that it's possible to accelerate the processing time by paying 213.00 Euros (as of Sept, 2019)


* Application Submission

In the case of a US citizen coming to The Netherlands using the Blue Card, the application must be submitted to the IND by your employer, acting as the sponsor (that is, the application must be sent to the IND with your company's address used as the return and a company representative listed as the contact).




* Acknowledgement of Receipt

Once the application is received, the IND will take 10 days to scan it into their system and send an Acknowledgement of Receipt letter.  This letter will contain the applicant's vreemdeling number (or 'v-number').  Using this number, the applicant will be able to schedule an appointment to register with the municipality and obtain their citizen number - BSN.

* Options for Appointments


Applicants can schedule appointments with the Gemeente (municipal office) or, for a fee (but with the advantage of faster processing) use the In Amsterdam Center (https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/our-network/in-amsterdam/contact-us ). I used the In Amsterdam Center and was happy with the service they offered but it did cost, in total, almost 600 Euros (this is inclusive of the BSN processing, registration and Blue Card pick-up appointment).





## Documents the Applicant Needs to Register

To properly register, there are a few things the applicant needs:

* Passport (of course)
* Employment Contract (provided by Cloudreach)
* Rental agreement document
* Birth certificate (apostilled by the issuing authority - information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention )
* Marriage certificate, if married (also apostilled)

The applicant will need to check with her or his local US State rules regarding how to have vital documents apostilled. Do not neglect this step; Dutch immigration will not grant residency status if your documents have not been authorized.


* Notice of Decision Letter

After the applicant has registered with the government and received a BSN (Citizen Service Number - similar in purpose to the American Social Security number) the IND will, at some point, send a notice of decision letter. I say, ‘at some point’ because the IND has a legally allowed time allotment of 90 days to make a decision so the letter may arrive at any point during this window. 

Once the letter has arrived (and, like the Acknowledgement of Receipt letter, it will arrive at the Cloudreach BV office on Herengracht), assuming the decision was positive, the next step is to schedule an appointment to record biometrics - fingerprints and an iris scan.  Like the appointment for registration and receiving a BSN, this can be done either at a Gemeente office (https://www.amsterdam.nl/) or at the In Amsterdam Center (note that the In Amsterdam Center charges a fee). Remember to bring your passport.

During the appointment, the government agent will place a temporary residence stamp in your passport that will be good for three months (needed if you’re travelling outside of the Netherlands before your official Blue Card (which, remember, is also your residency card) arrives.

## 30 Percent Ruling 

The Dutch Tax Authority provides a temporary (4 years) 30 percent tax rate for highly skilled migrants. 

Information: https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/living/take-care-of-official-matters/highly-skilled-migrants/thirty-percent-ruling 

To obtain this benefit, the applicant must submit an application and provide supporting documentation such as:

* De-registration letter from a municipality (this doesn't apply in the US situation)
* 17 months of bank statements showing your payment of rent or mortgage in your origin location
* 17 months of mortgage or rental statements (for example invoices from your rental agency or the bank holding a house mortgage)
* 17 months of utility bills 

Tips for working with the IND.

●	Do not be shy about calling them to inquire about the status of your case (of course, be polite) from outside the Netherlands: +31 880 430 430 (once in the country leave out the country code of course)

●	Do not be shy about calling them on a routine basis throughout the process; I’ve found this helps your application have somewhat greater visibility

●	Note that the IND is extra busy due to the confusion caused by Brexit as many UK residents of the Netherlands try to confirm or adjust their status
